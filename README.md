# landing-page
You can view the website here: https://connor-skudlarek.github.io/landing-page/

This is a landing page template I made using exclusively CSS flex. The images sourced are copyright free.
There are no external links and buttons do not submit any information.

This template can be adjusted to fit many different companies or used for personal website landing pages, such as a political call to action or a memorial page.
